## Important Notice: Phase 1 Start Date Postponement and Sample Dataset Release

Dear Participants,

We want to inform you that the start date of Phase 1 for the CSL competition has been slightly delayed due to unforeseen circumstances related to the real-world dataset required. As you know, we have been diligently working to ensure the availability of the dataset while adhering to strict data privacy policies to safeguard the interests of all parties involved. Despite our best efforts, we encountered some unforeseen challenges in obtaining the necessary permissions and complying with the data privacy guidelines.

In light of this, we have made the decision to postpone the start date of Phase 1. The **new start date for Phase 1** of the CSL competition is now rescheduled for **August 15, 2023**. This additional time will allow us to finalize the dataset and ensure that all participants have equal access to the most relevant and up-to-date information.

We understand that this change may inconvenience some of you who have been eagerly preparing for the competition. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and assure you that this decision was not taken lightly. Our primary focus is to maintain the integrity and fairness of the competition for all participants. While we regret the delay, we believe that the new start date will enable us to deliver an exceptional competition experience for everyone involved.

In the meantime, to support your preparation, we will be releasing a sample dataset and demonstrative code on August 8th. This resource will help you get familiar with the data format and assist you in adjusting your methods accordingly. The sample dataset and code will be available for download at [Sample](https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/tree/master/competition/NeurIPS2023).

I appreciate your understanding, and we look forward to your participation and wish you the best of luck!

Sincerely,

CSL Competition Organizing Team
