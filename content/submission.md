* Participants will submit their methods through [CodaLab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/13902).
* We will provide a starter kit through [Github](https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/tree/master/competition/NeurIPS2023) that contains everything you need to create your own code submission and some baseline methods.  
* The above will get ready before the start of the competition.
